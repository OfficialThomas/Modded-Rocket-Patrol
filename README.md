# Modded-Rocket-Patrol
Second assignment of CMPM 120 during Summer 2021. A Phaser 3 clone/remake of the APF-M1000 built-in gallery shooter, Rocket Patrol. This version includes modifications made to the game to change the experience.

The mods for this game include:
- A time display for seconds remaining
- Additional time when a ship is destroyed
- Rocket is now controlled by the mouse and fired with left click
- New artwork for in-game assets (rocket, spaceship, explosion)
- New explosion sfx that are randomized on player impact
- A New ship that's smaller and faster and worth more
