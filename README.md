Second assignment of CMPM 120 during Summer 2021. A Phaser 3 clone/remake of the APF-M1000 built-in gallery shooter, Rocket Patrol. This version includes modifications made to the game to change the experience.

Point Breakdown:
- Display the time remaining (in seconds) on the screen (10)
- Implement a new timing/scoring mechanism that adds time to the clock for successful hits (20)
- Implement mouse control for player movement and mouse click to fire (20)
- Create new artwork for all of the in-game assets (rocket, spaceships, explosion) (20) 
- Create 4 new explosion SFX and randomize which one plays on impact (10)
- Create a new spaceship type (w/ new artwork) that's smaller, moves faster, and is worth more points (20)

NOTES:
For the explosion sfx, I included 4 new sfx for a total of 5. It may take more than 5 hits to hear all the explosion sounds in the game.
